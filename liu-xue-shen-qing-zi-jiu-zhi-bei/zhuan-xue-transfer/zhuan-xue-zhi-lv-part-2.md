Hello guys\~ How's your holiday?

This post will be a continuation of the previous one entitled My Transfer Journey (Part 1). Hope you will find it useful.

After the failure of transferring to a British university, I was depressed for a long time and could not even find an opportunity to vent my emotions. Anyway, with the encouragement of my parents and friends, I began to think about the possibility of **transferring to an American university.** In the previous social networking process, I met many friends who chose to transfer to an overseas university like me, and many of them have a destination of the States. As a result, there isn’t much hardship in acquiring information. It just came naturally to me. Here, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to the **transfer community** ‘**XJTLU\&UNNC️🛫北美**’ for their tremendous help and support.

### **Introduction**

In this section, I’ll give a brief introduction of the basics of transferring to an American university. First of all, here are something you need to prepare before the submission.

Items required: (Red letters relate to important admissions criteria)

1.  **Different essay(s)** required by different university.

    _- E.g., for NYU, 2 essays are required including one Why NYU essay and one Why major essay._

    _- In this case, **the more universities you want to apply for, the more paperwork you have to do** to meet their requirement!_
2. Your **XJTLU transcript** and the enrollment status letter.
3.  Your high school certificate and transcript, including your grade nine transcript from you junior high.

    _- Different university have different policies of receiving them. E.g., for NYU, they require you to **mail** the official transcript. However, for UMN, delivering your official transcript via your **current university’s / high school’s official email** is permitted._
4. Some universities require you to upload 1-2 reference letter(s).
5.  Your language proficiency test report (IELTS/ TOEFL / PTE etc.)

    _- **TOEFL (>100) is recommended**, because some universities require a higher score in terms of IELTS (e.g., NYU requires IELTS band≥7.5)._

    _- Most universities require an **IELTS score of 7 (6.5)** or an **TOEFL score of 90-100 (21-25).** Please check the threshold case by case._

    _- Again, the higher the better, but this **do not contribute to your admission**. It's only a threshold._
6.  Additional identification documents / information required by submission platform.

    \- _Different universities have **different application platforms**, e.g., for NYU, Common app; for UIUC, the university’s own platform._

Additionally, **GPA is still the most important issue** that determines your admission. Generally speaking, if you want to apply for top 30 universities, a GPA of ≥3.9 is recommended. If your target is a top 50 university, a GPA of ≥3.7 is recommended (\* popular majors have higher requirement). Universities in other tiers have maybe lower standard. Here ‘top’ means the **national rankings** of American universities rather than **world rankings**.

To be honest, the possible top 30 universities that consider we XJTLUers are basically limited to **Umich, USC, UVA, UNC, WFU UF and NYU**, with even a **lower possibility for NYU**. Umich is **traditionally friendlier** with transfer students since they lose a great number of transfer students leaving them every year (due to low GPA given and more competitive environment).

### **Limited college choices**

Because of the belated rejection from British universities, I turned to the United States **at the end of March.** This delay caused me a **huge contraction** in terms of school selection in the United States. There basically remains very few universities whose application deadline hadn’t expired.

Possible choices left at that time:

* PSU – Econ
* Purdue – Econ
* NYU – Econ
* UMN – Econ

Unfortunately, some great universities such as Umich, UIUC and Wisc have already reached their application deadline, so I try to contact their admission office via email in order to ask for a **late submission**. The surprising result is that **UIUC approved my petition** and offered me a late submission link where I can upload my application materials, while Umich and Wisc wanted me to apply for their spring term.

Thus, after much thought, I applied to three universities, including NYU, UIUC and UMN. Here, I would like to recommend **UMN** to students majoring in business, especially economics. Although UMN has a low QS ranking, it still performs well in **USnews ranking (55)**. The Econ major of UMN has high rankings among various list. Take Shanghai Ranking (软科, ARWU) as an example, which is well known to we Chinese, its **Economics major ranks 20th in the world**. By exploring the curriculum provided by the Department of Economics in this university, it can be learned that the Economics major provides 3 different types of degree directions: **BS, BA quant track and BA**, which can not only meet the requirements of **quantitative background** when applying for master degree, but also provide an option for students who resist mathematics in their undergraduate study. Apart from this, Econ students will also be offered an opportunity to study **postgraduate courses** in their junior or senior year, which gives them the advantage of extending their academic background.

### **I’m an Illini!**

Selections & results

* UMN – Econ admission
* UIUC – Econ admission
* NYU – Econ rejection

Two out of three, that's not bad. Clearly, I’m gonna confirm the offer of UIUC and plan to change my major to **BSLAS Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (STEM)** and minor in **Computer Science** to enrich my programming and quantitative background. As for the rejection of NYU, I would like to tell you that neither the no.1 student in Econ & Fin in the class of 2020 (myself) nor the no.1 student in the class of 2019 was admitted to the Economics major of NYU, so we’d better **focus more on Umich** instead of NYU in terms of this major.

Regarding the core requirement and optional curriculum of BSLAS Econometrics and Quantitative Economics, I’ll put the related materials below for your reference.

_**Figure 1. core currirulum of BSLAS Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (STEM)**_Figure 2. Econometrics; Microeconomics; Macroeconomics Electives_**Figure 3. Core curriculum of CS minor**_

We can see that both majors and minors have **abundant courses for electives** and students can select an **interdisciplinary schedule** to complete their undergraduate study and become a **compound talent**. When it comes to housing, I20, English placement test and tuition fee issues, please refer to ‘**My Illini**’ platform for further information.

**Implications**

4

From the results we can discover the following implications / insights which I hope can be beneficial for your future transfer plan.

* American universities are generally **friendlier** to transfer students than their British counterparts. One of the most important reasons is that American universities have a **well-established transfer system** from a very early age, ‘transfer’ is a common phenomenon for them.
* For students who apply very early (e.g., in Jan), you are likely to get an offer from Umich, UVA, UNC, UF and other **Top30 universities** if you meet the basic requirements and have a relatively **strong background**.
* For Top 50 universities, BU, UoR, **UIUC, Wisc**, NEU, OSU and Purdue are really good choices for you. Again, you have to meet the specific requirements of different universities.
* What is obvious is that there is a **wider range of (universities) choices** to transfer to an American university than a British university. On an extreme / disdainful / discriminatory note, American universities have a **higher degree of recognition** than British universities (except for the four universities I have mentioned in the previous post).
* The preparation for applying to American universities is **tedious** and the application materials are **varied**. However, I still recommend you to **do it yourself** if your target schools are only restricted to 2-3 universities. Unless you have a greater application need (8-10), I suggest that **DIY is a process that makes you more mature and improves your efficiency, planning and practice ability**.
* Some universities like UIUC are capable of offering you a so-called '**late submission**' opportunity and are **likely to offer you admission** in this case.

### **End of my transfer journey**

Thank you for reading this far. To be honest, my entire transfer application process went hand in hand with my college courses and background promotion activities (internships). You probably can't imagine the circumstance of being overwhelmed by a pile of tasks falling on you. During the sophomore year, I was exhausted and could not even sleep well because of the failure at the initial stage, but **everything seems to be the best arrangement.** I made it through, got the ideal offer and also consider this period as a fairly productive one.

With respect to acknowledgement section, I really want to express my gratitude to a great many people. First of all, special thanks to **Prof. Jingming Guo**, **Associate Dean Dr. Nimesh Salike**, and my **intern supervisor Mr. Jing Zhang** for your reference letters and long-term guidance. Secondly, I want to thank **my roommates**, **Xiaoang Jia, Zhenxiao Zhang,** and **Yuchen Cao**, for their emotional support and comfort during my most difficult time, and **all of my friends in the WeChat group ‘XJTLU\&UNNC️🛫北美’** for their professional consultancy and cutting-edge transfer information. In addition, thank you **Yunhong Wang, Xinrui Liu**, who had the vacant dorm reserved for me as a backdoor to 2+2 study routes (Liverpool) when all my transfer attempts in the UK failed. Thank you **Jiawei Huang, Kehan Lin, Yao Li, Runqing Chen, Xinyu Shen**, who offered me much academic support in my major study during this period. Finally, sincere thanks to **my parents**, who provided me with double care in terms of my daily life and academic logistics at the height of the epidemic.

During the period of online teaching & learning, I thought I was lonely, but this long-term loneliness forced me to **actively explore myself and get along well with myself**. I could see myself most clearly when it was the darkest, and I met people willing to offer me a helping hand when I was most helpless. Thinking of this, **I want to love the world again, again and again**.

Hope the pandemic will end soon.

See you next time\~
