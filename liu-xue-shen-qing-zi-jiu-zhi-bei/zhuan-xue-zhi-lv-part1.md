Hello\~ Hope this post finds you very well.

As I have mentioned in my last post, this article will be a short retrospect of the tough transfer process I have experienced since Oct. 2021.

### **Decision Made**

The first time I heard about 'transfer' is at a PWC job fair. During the meeting, I had the honor to know a senior student who has now transferred to Warwick and is majoring in MORSE. She told me that with the transcript of XJTLU, we could transfer to an overseas university (typically in the UK and the US) with a higher ranking and bigger platform.&#x20;

At that time, I had already entered the economics and finance major at XJTLU, and was told that the financial industry in China highly values the bachelor's degree, or frankly speaking, school ranking and reputation. From then on, I had the idea of leaving my current university. Later, after the discussion with my parents and confirming their support, I made the decision to transfer to a **Britsh university**.

### **Preparation before the application**

Actually, for the application to a British university, there's not much to be prepared and **you can definitely complete the submission by yourself (meaning that: no need for an intermediary agency).** You can apply for 5 universities in total via the UCAS platform. Basically we XJTLUers won't be considered by G5 universities since they hardly accept 'transfer' students. However, in terms of KCL, U of Manchester, U of Edinburgh, Warwick U, things might be different. This year, everything seems very tough for student trying to transfer to these universities, even though they are in the second tier.

Items required: (_Bold letters relate to important admissions criteria_)

1. A **personal statement** (AKA PS, for 5 schools, in this case no specified requirement)
2. Your **XJTLU transcript** and the enrollment status letter.
3. Your high school certificate and transcript.
4. One reference letter from your professor or AA.
5. IELTS report, a score of 7 (6.5) will be appropriate. The higher the better, but this do not contribute to your admission. It's only a threshold.
6. Additional Identification documents required by UCAS.

Originally, I tried to simulate a possible admission background for business students. However, after I received all the decisions (except for KCL), I realized that the specific situation for every year is completely different and **all predictions / so-called guarantee / past experiences are useless**. Therefore, I will only put **my own background** in the following for your reference:

* GPA (Freshman year): 4.0/4.0; 85 in British scoring system; ranking 1st/300 in Econ\&Fin major; No disadvantaged (<70) subjects
* 2 internships completed
* 1 business training camp in progress
* 1 business contest in progress\

* IELTS: 8 (6.5)&#x20;
* University Academic Excellence Award
* Several volunteer experiences

### **Sad news**

Selection & Results:\


1. U of M Econ\&Fin - rejected
2. U of E Econ\&Fin - rejected
3. KCL Math\&Man\&Fin - no decision yet
4. WU: Econ - rejected
5. Bristol: Econ\&Fin - withdrawed

Up to this stage, I'm totally speechless, exhausted and bewildered. However, I still want to kindly remind you of the following facts. First of all, the near-total collapse was partly due to a **surge in the number of students applying**. The same logic fits for the rat race of the postgraduate entrance exam in China nowadays.&#x20;

Secondly, there's **no well-established transfer system** for the UK and the so-called 'transfer student' is not the norm for British universities. Actually nearly all of them **refuse to accept transfer credits**, meaning that you have to **restart from freshman year**.&#x20;

Finally, I would like to attribute part of the failure to myself, in terms of the timeline, the personal statement, the activities and the agency chosen. I didn't achieve a good **incorporation** between my activities and PS and there always remains some **asymmetric information** between the agency and myself (also between me and the entire transfer world).

I have been waiting for the decision from KCL since March and I think the portal will be updated in a few days.

### **Implications**

Ultimately, let's talk about some potential warning / insights / implications / inspiration from my experience above regarding the transfer to a British school.\


* Please make sure that you have **comprehensive information** about the universities and majors you are applying to before submission / DDL. Especially on the transfer level, as opposed to the regular application (Alevel). The **possible channels** are: senior students, intermediaries / agencies around the school (and their official accounts), social platforms (such as Zhihu), community (wechat group) of transfer students in XJTLU, and direct inquiries to the school (via email).
* **Do the application yourself if you can.** Find an agent if you HAVE TO (i.e., you are as lazy as me). Again, making an application for a Britsh university is **easy peasy**. DIY itself is an enhancement to your abilities and contributes to the maturity of your mind and personality.
* Revise your PS to **perfection**. You can find services at appropriate price on Taobao to retouch / polish up your paperwork, so don't be reluctant to spend the money.
* For business students, try **not to choose popular majors (**e.g., Acc \&Fin, Econ & Fin, Econ, Acc, and other Fin related majors**)**, **interdisciplinary majors or those close to social sciences** (e.g., Economics in School of Social Science) can be further considered.
* If you have similar target universities as I do, please seize every opportunity to participate in **high-quality activities** such as internship and research (SURF) while **maintaining your GPA** (>=3.8, or 75 in British system).
* You'd better prepare and take the IELTS / TOEFL (>100) exam **in the winter vacation**, and do not drag to the beginning of the spring term at XJTLU since this will probably affect your attention on the study of the school subjects. Besides, the absence of language proficiency test report will **delay or influence** the review of your UCAS application.\


### **End of Part 1**

Thank you for reading this far. I have to say that an unfortunate conclusion can be made for business students at XJTLU who have the motivation to transfer, that is,  transferring to a second-tier British university has become impossible for the majority of you (99%).&#x20;

If you are still obsessed with them, please be sure to take the one-year Alevel exam instead of using your XJTLU transcript to do the application, which will be a lot more easier, and even provides you with possibility to attend a G5 university. Nevertheless, a one-year alevel course represents considerable opportunity cost for every XJTLUer, and deserves a thinking-twice before you go for it.

I must admit that my application to the British universities does not go well, or rather was a complete failure. This leads me to consider the transfer possibility to an American university, which turns out to be a fair success soon afterwards. This transfer journey to a university in the US will be covered in more details in my next post. Stay tuned!

Hope the pandemic will end soon.

See you next time\~
