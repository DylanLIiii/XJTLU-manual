Hi there!&#x20;

This is a short review of the 2nd semester of my sophomore year at XJTLU. Though the entire period was spent at home for most XJTLUers, we are not idle at all. Simply for me, I didn't forsee that there was gonna be a brand (bunch) new (of) story (shit) waiting for me to explore at the beginning of the semester, or of 2022.

_**Academically, ...**_

As a tradition, I will attach a summary of my lecture notes to this section and leave some special comments.

You might have a thought that 'oh...what a hardworking boy...'. In fact, however, this is only half of the endeavour than what I had devoted to my modules in the last semester. Anyway, everything will be reflected on the final marks, no worries. Aside from my efforts, I would like to express my 一箩筐的吐槽 on some of these modules. Let's start snarking / recommending them one by one....&#x20;

1. **My favorite course: SPA003** \
   Reasons: charming teachers who is proficient in multiple languages (Spanish, English, Japanese, Russian, ...), desirable marks, interesting spanish culture, great vibes during and after class, relaxing but rewarding!!!
2.  **The course I hate most: ECO120**

    Reasons: A lot of boring abstraction to remember, assumptions, variables, correlations, models etc. However, it gives me an illusion that I am able to make appropriate comments or even suggestions on economic situations and current economic policies (or even: I am an economist!!!) seems still fruitful.
3.  **The course that makes me speechless: FIN102**

    Reasons: PPT with over **130 pages** for one lecture, talkative teacher with his **5h video** (听我说谢谢你). However (as always), thank you Dr. JaeYung for such an easy exam questions as final. Below are some rediculous evidences.
4.  **A wolf in sheep's clothing: ECO118**

    Reasons: refer to the picture below.

    However (as always), ... I am lucky to be chosen as a member of Dr. Shuyang's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship **(AKA SURF)** team, who is the **most handsome** teacher I have ever seen at XJTLU and a very amazing PHD graduated from **Cornell**. Thank you Shuyang, there's much more to learn from you.
5.  The course whose instructor wants to save the world: **ACC104**

    Reasons: As the saying goes, '**teacher, vegatable vegatable, lao lao'.** Our dear Dr. Zuo will definitely turn into a superwoman and save you in the final. I'm just kidding..but the truth is that she did save us all.

To wrap up for this section: I am academically a junior now, hurrrrray!

### _**Career planning and Business contest**_

This section will introduce some internships I have done and a business contest I participated in during the period.

*   **Guotai Junan Securities(Suzhou) - IBD intern**

    Responsible for writing basic situation investigation reports for 5 unlisted enterprises, involving market analysis of related industries, product analysis and financial analysis of the company.&#x20;
*   **Jiangsu Zhengwei Law Firm - paralegal**

    Participated in a special training themed on cross-border trade settlement and financing and learned about the common risks of cross-border trade contracts, the impact of the epidemic on contract performance obligations, and the legal and policy responses to cross-border trade disputes.
*   **Business Analysis and Financial Modeling Camp - trainee**

    Participated in the training and independently wrote the _**POPMART**_ company research report, mastered the basic framework and common tools of company analysis.
*   A nice try: **JP Morgan Private Bank Challenge**

    Responsible for: Using ETF (exchanged traded fund) to track the selected underlyings, and backtested the historical data of relevant funds, build the return prediction model of the portfolio in the next 40 years, refine the asset valuation of each year, and conservative estimate the annual return rate of our portfolio. **FIN102 matters!**

In short, I explored the financial market and experienced potential jobs offered by the market. A preliminary foundation or understanding is established for working as a financial analyst. Besides, I completed the second round of interview of Deloitte Club and hope that it will finally turn out to be a good news.

### _**Plans for my future undergraduate study**_

As some of you have already heard it announced in different occasions, I will be leaving XJTLU at the end of this semester. No matter where I am, as long as there's anything I could help or even if you'd just like to catch up, **don't hesitate to reach out to me**. A more specific introduction of my transfer process will be given in the next article/message broadcasted from this official account.

### _**Acknowledgement**_

First of all, I want to thank all of the instructors and professors who are responsible to teach me in any module during this semester, thank you for you patience and tolerance for my stupid questions. Secondly, a great many thanks to my intimate friends (especially, Derek and Jiawei). Your help, guidance and enlightening always served as sorts of unconditional support that warms me in the darkest time. Of course, my parents deserve my gratitude, who provided me with double care in terms of my daily life and academic logistics at the height of the epidemic.

Finally, I want to thank myself for finding a way to get along with myself during this time when I was shackled by the pandemic. Loneliness and independence are not contradictory at times, and they even incorporate with each other, enabling me to see a more clearly and mature self with each exhausted moment.

Hope you enjoy my experience over the past five months.&#x20;

Hope the pandemic will end soon.

I'd like to see you next time.&#x20;

¡Hasta luego!
